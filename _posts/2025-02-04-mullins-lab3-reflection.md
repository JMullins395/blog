Lab 3 was interesting.  A lot of new ground was covered this time around, just as before.  My reflections are as follows.

### What was new

The SCSS format of stylesheets that were central to this assigment were definitely an experience.  All of the presets and the very thorough compartmentalization and generalization of nearly everything I could possibly think of to modify or play around with during this assignment were kind of staggering.  Even now, I'm sure there's some more options and sub-presets buried in the folders in this repository that I haven't even come across yet.  On the plus side though, I made this cool [short info page about gundam](https://jmullins395.github.io/blog/gundam.html) right here on the blog site.  While we're on that topic, here's a picture of one of several 1:1 scale "Gundam Statues" around the world (this one is of the original RX-78-2, located in Tokyo), just to give an impression of the size of these things in the shows:

### What I struggled with

I struggled for quite a bit with both some of the aspects of altering the styling under the SCSS format.  The syntax is the same, sure, but to find the coreect classes/ids to point to, I had to do quite a lot more digging and scrutinizing since often what I was wanting to do necessitated digging through to some preset or another, sometimes nested within multiple layers of folders.  I get why, of course, but it was still a bit of a pain, especially at first.  Was still fun though.  The feeling when something previously unknown to me would finally click kind of felt akin to any of those scenes from a 90s techno thriller where a computer is involved and there is some sort of screen effect like this:

### What still doesn't make sense

Definitely how some of the templates and custom presets play with one another.  For example, I edited the style section for what I assumed corresponded to specifically blog posts in the main section of the site (like this one), and yet some of the other pages, like the "About" page and the "Gundam" section I made, both of which inhabit the navbar at the top of the blog, inherited the settings I built out for mainline blog posts.  Evidently, I need to dig into it a bit more to find what caused that, but I can't really complain for the moment since if anything it offers a more consistent look and feel, even if that wasn't my original intent.

### What I am looking forward to

I'm looking forward to figuring out how to do the necessary make a more vibrant blog space that feels more alive.  It'd be cool to make something similar to the [Gundam Fandom Wiki page](https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/The_Gundam_Wiki), for example, though properly filling out something like that will obviously necessitate a lot more content and it would likely look pretty empty for a while.  But I sense bells and whistles on the horizon, and I'm looking forward to them eagerly, even if I have but a tenous grasp of what I'm doing in the first moments.

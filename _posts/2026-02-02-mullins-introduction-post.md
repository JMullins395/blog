This is my first post to this blog!  A lot of the things I had to do to get to this point before even starting to write this.  I will now describe them.

### What was new to me:

- Having a blog in general; doing this on my own had never even crossed my mind!
- All of the tools needed to make this start happening.
- Using a markdown text file as I am using to write this.  Totally new experience for me actually.

### What parts I struggled with:

The biggest part I struggled with was most definitely the Ruby install.  I used the download from [this](https://rubyinstaller.org/) site, and got as far as downloading the Ruby package onto my computer, but actually getting it to where I needed it was another matrer entirely!  I tried some different angles of attack, but finally ended up asking Dr Goadrich for help.  He sent me a link to a [tutorial](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/), and following that led pretty linearly to a solution to the problem thereafter.  There were other minor hiccups in the process of this assignment, but the entire Ruby install and hookup process was definitely the biggest struggle for me personally.

### What things still don't make sense:

I still don't really know what exactly "Ruby" or a "gem" is, beyond Ruby being yet another new coding language/tool that is currently proving useful and will continue to be so going forward.  I am sure I will come to know the intricacies of what is driving the processes allowing me to write this blog in due time, but for now I mainly know some of the basics of how to use it.  The deeper, "behind the scenes" knowledge and undertanding eludes me for the time being.

### What I am looking forward to:

I'm really looking forward to getting enough of a hang of this to be able to make steadily more intricate and detailed blog posts.  Who knows, I might even use a blog of this kind for my own personal purposes at some point in the future, be they for business or for pleasure!  It seems like there's a lot of stuff I could do with this general structure, in any case.

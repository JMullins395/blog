My name is Jack Mullins.  I'm a Computer Science major at Hendrix College in my Junior year, and my hometown is Gulfport, Mississippi.  I am a big fan of [NASCAR](https://www.nascar.com/), the [Gundam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gundam) franchise, amongst other things, and enjoy certain creative pursuits in my spare time, such as writing, sketching, 3D printing, and building model kits.  I am also on the school swim team.

This is a little page where I decided to put some info about one of my favorite media franchises: the Gundam franchise!  There are a lot of entries to the series, starting with the original [Mobile Suit Gundam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Suit_Gundam), which aired in 1979.  

The original series depicts a far future, in a time period dubbed as the "Universal Century" where humanity has expanded into space, moving much of the population into space colonies placed in clusters at orbital lagrange points.  Here is an image of these colonies:

However, due to unequal treatment by the earth government, some of the colonies become disgruntled, and the cluster furthest from earth on the far side of the moon ("Side 3") declares independence as the "Principality of Zeon" and launches an all-out attack on the Earth Federation, in what the series refers to as the "One Year War".  Both sides use large, humanoid "Mobile Suits" alongside more typical military forces to wage this destructive war.  Zeon's main Mobile Suit is the "Zaku", and the series' main character, Amuro Ray, pilots a powerful prototype suit, the RX-78-2 Gundam, on behalf of the Federation.  Below, in order of appearance, are pictures of the Gundam and an example of the Zaku-series suits used by Zeon.

As an avid self-proclaimed history buff, a keen enjoyer of sci-fi, and a fan of all kinds of media involving large machines like the mobile suits, I really like Gundam a lot, and for several reasons.  One is obviously the robots fighting each other, which is enjoyable even on a surface level.  But beyond that, the show is also a poignant commentary on the realities of war.  The series tackles topics such as the likes of genocide, war crimes, the dangers of fascist ideology, and the human cost of warfare at both a personal and societal level.  Some particular aspects even mirror real history.  For example, Amuro Ray is just 15 years old at the start of the series, mirroring the usage of child soldiers in the armed forces of Imperial Japan in the Second World War; this was a conscious choice by series creator Yoshiyuki Tomino.  

Today, the franchise has an immense number of entries, with over 80 TV series, movies, OVAs, and short films, as well as prodigious mangas and novelizations.  There are also many alternate universes and timelines as well, though the original "Universal Century" remains the most fleshed-out.
